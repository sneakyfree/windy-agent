**Test Results:** 949 passed, 37 skipped, 0 failed
**Version:** 0.5.1

## DNA Strand — 8 Key Questions

### 1. Multiple LLM providers?
**Status:** FIXED — IMPLEMENTED
`models.py` routes to OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-native SDKs. `providers.py` defines 12 built-in providers. Model routing works via exact match, prefix match, and active provider config.

### 2. Skill sandbox restricts dangerous operations?
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (v1 scope)
Subprocess sandbox restricts PATH and cwd to `/tmp`. Evaluator has BANNED_PATTERNS regex blocklist. No Docker/seccomp/OS-level isolation — regex blocklist is bypassable. Matches spec intent for v1.

### 3. Cognitive decay runs on schedule?
**Status:** FIXED — IMPLEMENTED
`main.py` starts `_start_decay_scheduler()` daemon thread running `run_decay()` every 24 hours.

### 4. Personality versioning detects drift?
**Status:** FIXED
`run_periodic_drift_check()` is now called in the decay scheduler alongside `run_decay()` every 24 hours in `main.py:47`.

### 5. "Never Wrong Twice" injects correction skills?
**Status:** FIXED
`failure_detector.py` now creates correction skills via `save_skill()` when recurring failures are detected and links them via `correction_skill_id`. Non-recurring failures still get basic correction prompts.

### 6. Cost tracker enforces daily budget?
**Status:** FIXED — IMPLEMENTED
`loop.py` calls `check_budget()` before every LLM call. Over-budget returns message without making the LLM call.

### 7. Sub-agent system spawns sub-agents?
**Status:** FIXED — IMPLEMENTED
`sub_agents.py` has `spawn_sub_agent()` with isolated context, token budget, cost logging. Depth-limited to 1.

### 8. Offline queue flushes on reconnect?
**Status:** FIXED
`replay_queued_messages()` is now called on Matrix reconnect in `channels/matrix_bot.py:444-449`. Messages are replayed with exponential backoff retry loop.

## Findings (Fresh Scan — 2026-04-03, final pass)

### N1. Bare `except Exception:` — RESOLVED
~~102 instances~~ → ~~34 remaining~~ → **0 remaining in critical paths**. All `except Exception:` blocks in `write_queue.py`, `versioning.py`, and other modified files now have `as e` with logging. Remaining bare excepts in CLI/UX code (quickstart.py, cli_status.py, birth_certificate.py) are intentional graceful-degradation patterns.

### N2. Previously flaky tests — ALL FIXED
All 5 previously flaky tests now pass reliably:
- `test_intent_saved_from_message` — Fixed with `wq._queue.join()`
- `test_orchestrate_hatch_all_fields_populated` — Fixed with `clean_env` fixture
- `test_same_agent_section` — Fixed with `monkeypatch.delenv()`
- `test_blocks_when_over_budget` — Fixed with singleton reset (`_ch._tracker`, `_interaction_count`)
- `test_simultaneous_messages_no_deadlock` — Fixed with WriteQueue start/stop + `busy_timeout=30000`

### N2b. Bridge integration test — FIXED
`test_full_roundtrip` now mocks `is_online` and resets singletons. Assertion changed to `in` check to accommodate context header prepend.

### N3. CI Python 3.14 — FIXED
CI matrix now includes `["3.12", "3.13", "3.14"]`.

### N4. mypy in CI — FIXED
`py_compile` replaced with `uv run mypy src/windyfly/ --ignore-missing-imports`.

### N5. `integrations/` package — FIXED
Empty directory deleted. No references existed in codebase.

### N6. Mail rate limiter — FIXED (previous pass)

### N7. `correction_skill_id` — FIXED
`failure_detector.py` now creates correction skills via `save_skill()` for recurring failures and passes `correction_skill_id` to `log_failure()`.

### N8. 0 TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in source — CLEAN

### N9. 0 hardcoded secrets — CLEAN

### N10. All network calls have timeouts — CLEAN

### N11. 0 broken imports — CLEAN

### N12. `remote/` dead code — FIXED
Directory deleted.

### N13. Pre-existing ruff lint warnings — FIXED
~~30 ruff warnings~~ → **0 remaining**. All unused imports removed, ambiguous variable names (`l`→`line`) renamed, E402 import ordering fixed, F821 undefined names resolved with `TYPE_CHECKING` imports, unused variable assignments removed. Also fixed a real bug: `_step_mail()` in `hatch_orchestrator.py` was using `owner_id` without receiving it as a parameter.

### Production Deployment Checklist

1. **Skill sandbox hardening** — v2 consideration: Docker/seccomp isolation for skill execution
2. **Pydantic utcnow deprecation** — 8 warnings from `datetime.utcnow()` in Pydantic models (upstream dependency, will resolve with Pydantic update)
